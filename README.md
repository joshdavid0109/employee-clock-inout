# Employee Attendance System

The Employee Attendance Recording System is a Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) application designed to streamline the process of recording daily time records (attendance) for employees in a small company. Developed to meet the specific requirements outlined by the systems administrator, this application provides a user-friendly interface for employees to log their time in and out, as well as an admin panel for generating reports based on specified date ranges.

Key Features:

- Secure Authentication: Employees log in to the system using their unique username and password to ensure secure access to the application. Authentication is implemented to authenticate users before allowing them to record their attendance.
- Time In/Out Recording: Employees can easily record their time in and out by simply clicking the respective buttons within the application. Additionally, employees are prompted to log their time in and out upon lunch breaks, ensuring accurate tracking of working hours throughout the day.
- Employee Monitoring: Employees have access to a personal dashboard where they can monitor their logged time records for the day. This feature enables employees to keep track of their attendance and ensure compliance with company policies.
- Admin Panel: Administrators have access to an admin panel where they can generate comprehensive reports pertaining to the logged time records of all employees. Reports can be generated by specifying a date range, providing administrators with valuable insights into employee attendance patterns over time.
- Centralized Database: All attendance records are stored in a centralized database, ensuring data integrity and accessibility. The use of Java RMI facilitates seamless communication between the client-side application and the server-side database, enabling efficient data management and retrieval.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.
